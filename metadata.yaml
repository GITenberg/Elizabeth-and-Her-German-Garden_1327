description: "Elizabeth and Her German Garden is a novel by Elizabeth von Arnim, first\
  \ published in 1898; it was very popular and frequently reprinted during the early\
  \ years of the 20th century.\nThe story is a year's diary written by the protagonist\
  \ Elizabeth about her experiences learning gardening and interacting with her friends.\
  \ It includes commentary on the beauty of nature and on society, but is primarily\
  \ humorous due to Elizabeth's frequent mistakes and her idiosyncratic outlook on\
  \ life.\nShe looked down upon the frivolous fashions of her time writing “I believe\
  \ all needlework and dressmaking is of the devil, designed to keep women from study.”\n\
  The book is the first in a series about the same character. It is noteworthy for\
  \ being published without a named author.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
